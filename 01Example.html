        <h1>All About Coin Tossing</h1>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the 
            air and checking which side is showing when it lands, in order to choose between two 
            alternatives, heads or tails, sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties. 
            It is a form of sortition which inherently has two possible outcomes. The party who calls 
            the side that the coin lands on wins.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p style="color:blue">
            The historical origin of coin flipping is the interpretation of a chance outcome as the 
            expression of divine will[citation needed].
            <br><br>
            Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had 
            a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. In England, this was referred 
            to as cross and pile.
